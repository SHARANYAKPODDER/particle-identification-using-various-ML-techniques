# particle-identification-using-various-ML-techniques
In this course project I trained a classifier to identify type of a particle. There are six particle types: electron, proton, muon, kaon, pion and ghost. Ghost is a particle with other type than the first five or a detector noise. 

Different particle types remain different responses in the detector systems or subdetectors. Thre are five systems: tracking system, ring imaging Cherenkov detector (RICH), electromagnetic and hadron calorimeters, and muon system.

Now, the main task is to identify a particle type using the responses in the detector systems.

I have done the above course project during my course-work "Artificial Intelligence(DSE313)" while studying at Indian Institute of Science Educatioon and Research(IISER) Bhopal in the 3rd year of my BS in Data Science.
